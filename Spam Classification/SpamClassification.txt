Spam Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes
Introduction
Spam classification is the task of automatically identifying whether an email or message is spam (unsolicited or unwanted) or ham (legitimate or wanted). Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) is a popular algorithm used for text classification tasks like spam classification. This documentation provides an overview of the spam classification process using MultinomialNB and outlines the necessary steps to implement it.

1. Prerequisites
To implement spam classification using MultinomialNB, you need the following prerequisites:

Python (version 3 or above)
NumPy and pandas libraries for data manipulation
Scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms

2. Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the data needs to be preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency. Preprocessing steps may include:

Removing any irrelevant information like email headers or HTML tags.
Converting the text to lowercase.
Removing punctuation and special characters.
Removing stop words (common words like "the," "is," etc. that do not carry much meaning).
Performing stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root form.

3. Model Training
MultinomialNB Algorithm
Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) is a probabilistic algorithm often used for text classification tasks. It assumes that the features (word frequencies in our case) are conditionally independent given the class label. To train the MultinomialNB model:

Split the preprocessed and feature-extracted data into training and testing sets.
Initialize an instance of the MultinomialNB class from scikit-learn.
Fit the model to the training data using the fit method.
