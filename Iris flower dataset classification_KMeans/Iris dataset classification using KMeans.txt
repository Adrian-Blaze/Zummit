Iris Flower Classification using KMeans clustering
Introduction
This documentation demonstrates the process of classifying Iris flowers into different species using KMeans clustering Classifier algorithm. The Iris dataset is loaded, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Classifier model is then trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.

1. Prerequisites
To run the code and perform Iris flower classification using the KMeans clustering Classifier, you need the following prerequisites:

Python (version 3 or above)
Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization
Scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms
You can install the required libraries using pip.

2. Dataset Overview
Data Loading
The Iris dataset is loaded using the load_iris function from scikit-learn. The dataset contains features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with corresponding target labels representing the Iris flower species.

3. Data Preprocessing
Data Splitting
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. This allows us to evaluate the performance of the KMeans clustering Classifier model on unseen data.

4. Model Training and Evaluation
The KMeans clustering Classifier model is trained using the training data, and its performance is evaluated on the test data using the score method. The accuracy score is printed to assess the model's classification performance.

5. Conclusion
In this documentation, we have shown how to load and preprocess the Iris dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and train a KMeans clustering Classifier model for flower classification. By following the steps, you can gain insights into the dataset and build a KMeans clustering Classifier model to classify Iris flowers into different species.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation for demonstration purposes. In practice, it is recommended to perform further analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to optimize the model's performance and generalize it to unseen data.
